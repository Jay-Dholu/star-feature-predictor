# Star Feature Predictor 🌟

Predict stellar properties with our model!
A machine learning-powered web application that predicts stellar properties like temperature, radius, luminosity, spectral class, and more — given the remaining features. Built using Flask, Scikit-learn, SQLAlchemy, and joblib.

## Note-

-Run the 'model-training.py' file to train the models and then all the models will be trained and stored in the folder called 'models'. And all set, you are ready to run web-app locally on your desktop.
