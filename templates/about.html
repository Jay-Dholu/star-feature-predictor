			<p>The Star Feature Predictor is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict missing stellar characteristics such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>🌡️ Temperature</li>
				<li>☀️ Luminosity</li>
				<li>🪐 Radius</li>
				<li>⚖️ Mass</li>
				<li>✨ Star Type</li>
				<li>🔢 Absolute Magnitude</li>
			</ul>
			<br>

			<p>This model was developed as a personal project to practice machine learning techniques using astronomical data.</p>
			<p>It predicts missing star features like temperature, radius, luminosity, and type based on known values, showcasing the power of data-driven inference in astrophysics.</p>
			<p>Perfect for experimenting with regression, classification, and feature prediction in a cosmic context.</p>
